A company altering its sender ID from a random phone number to their company name is a legitimate use of spoofing SMS messages. Similarly, you can spoof and send text messages to replace the originating mobile phone call number with a relevant one. Many businesses running campaigns do this to use their company name instead of a phone number.

Nevertheless, this practice can also be used to attack unsuspecting people. Targets receive text messages under the assumed identity of other companies or familiar mobile phone users or numbers. In fact, it is perhaps the ideal tool to conduct fraudulent activities. It masks the identity of the sender and replaces it with an identity theyâ€™re trying to imitate. As a result, a lot of scammers try to phish for personal information such as bank accounts, credit card details, and fake money transfers using such attacks.However we donot recommend to do any evil practices.
